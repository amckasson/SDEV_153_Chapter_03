<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>

<dl>
    <dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.
         Each yurt has<br> canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be 
         opened,<br> and a private deck.</dd>
    
    <dt><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt,
         comfy<br> couch, dining table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. 
         Your<br> luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and cold running water.<br> 
         Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>
    
    <dt><strong>What should I bring?</strong></dt>
    <dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing<br> weather 
        with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a<br>
        sense of adventure!</dd>
